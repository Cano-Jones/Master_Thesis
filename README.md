# PROBLEMS OF QUANTUM FIELD THEORIES ON CURVED SPACETIMES
Quantum Field Theory is the fundamental theoretical framework of the Stan-
dard Model of elementary particles. This theory is formulated in a Minkowski
space-time. However, the actual space-time metric is never of that type. On
Earth, even at short distances, the metric is affected by both the force of the
Earth’s gravity and the solar force, but especially by the acceleration of the
Earth’s motion. At large distances the cosmological data lead one to think
that, on average, the metric is of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberson-Walker
type.
The analysis of the quantization of fields in the presence of gravitational fields
involves a number of theoretical issues that we intend to explore in this thesis;
meaning how QFT can be adapted to introduce a gravitational background.
The key aspects treated throughout this thesis include the mathematical back-
ground that will be used; scalar fields in expanding universes; thermal aspects
of non inertial observers; and the renormalization problems regarding gravi-
tational dynamics.
