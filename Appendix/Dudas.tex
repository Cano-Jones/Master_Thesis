\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How do you know that there is a set of solutions of Klein Gordon such that the inner product fulfils the given results?
\end{itemize}
\section{To-Do}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minkowski scalar field.
	\item Move Units appendix to conventions.
	\item Add references! (e.g. covariant derivative).
	\item Particle detector and notion of particle (Unruh-DeWitt, ...). Maybe after Scalar field quantization 1.3 section.
	\item Quantum scalar fields in $\kappa$-Minkowski DSR? Maybe as an appendix? 
	\item Preface:	“Natura abhorret vacuum” (René Descartes), \textit{Horror vacui}.
\end{itemize}
