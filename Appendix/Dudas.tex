\section{Dudas}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How do you know that there is a set of solutions of Klein Gordon such that the inner product fulfils the given results?
	\item It's the Hamiltonian well defined?
	\item Can you always write a FLRW metric as a flat one with a coordinate change?
	\item Covariant derivatives, spin connection.
\end{itemize}
\section{To-Do}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chapter 2: equations suppose that $a_k$ are associated with $e^{-Et\hbar^{-1}}$, they should be associates with \textbf{positive} exponential....
	\item Minkowski scalar field.
\end{itemize}
